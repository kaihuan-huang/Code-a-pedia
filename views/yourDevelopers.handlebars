                    Intelligence at the University of York in the United Kingdom. In addition, I am studying Full
                    Stack Web Development at the UC Berkeley Extension School. I have worked at the $30B electric
                    car company NIO and LG in various functions such as intern and marketing. A few years ago, I
                    moved to the United States to pursue new opportunities and improve my English and Spanish
                    skills. After moving to Silicon Valley and meeting many brilliant people here, I decided that I
                    want to pursue a career as a software engineer. I have always enjoyed math and loved learning
                    about future technologies. I believe this is the best path for my skills and interests. </p>

                <p class="text-center">Greetings! Originally from Southern California, I have relocated lightyears
                    away into the Bay Area in Northern California to attend UC Berkeley. I graduated in 2018 with a
                    degree in Molecular and Cell Biology. Since then, I have done volunteer work and have completed
                    an Americorps Service working in clinics to support underserved communities and populations.
                    Now, I am working as a server at a local Oakland Restaurant and I am currently studying Full
                    Stack Web Development through UC Berkeley Extension. Working on this project has allowed me to
                    align my longtime love for making knowledge accessible to the masses and my new love for
                    learning to code. I am excited to continue my journey in Web Development as it combines my
                    passion for design, continuous learning opportunities, and working in team environments.</p>
